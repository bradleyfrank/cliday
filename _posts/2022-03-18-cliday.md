**Tip of the week:** Make Zsh help more helpful

Zsh does not enable a builtin `help` command, instead it provides `run-help`. By default `run-help` is an alias to `man` and will only work on external commands. To use it for Zsh builtins and features, load and unalias the command in your `.zshrc`.

```sh
autoload -Uz run-help
unalias run-help
alias help=run-help # for convenience
```

For example, you can now run `help whence`, `help history`, etc.
