1. [git-sweep](https://github.com/arc90/git-sweep): Clean up Git branches that have been merged into master
2. [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat): A cat(1) clone with wings
3. [rdfind](https://github.com/pauldreik/rdfind): find duplicate files utility

**Tip of the week:** You can avoid manually working with temp files by using ZSH process substitution:

Example:

```sh
% echo "Banana
Apple
Cucumber" > /path/to/file1
% sort /path/to/file1 > /path/to/file1 # Fails!

# Solution with a temp file:
% temp1=$(mktemp)
% sort /path/to/file1 > "$temp1"
% mv "$temp1" /path/to/file1

# Solution with process substitution:
% mv =(sort /path/to/file1) /path/to/file1
```
