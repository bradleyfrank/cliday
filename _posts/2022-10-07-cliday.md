**Article of the week**: [Why Didnâ€™t BSD Beat Out GNU and Linux?](https://www.channelfutures.com/open-source/open-source-history-why-didnt-bsd-beat-out-gnu-and-linux)

> Of course, BSD hardly disappeared entirely once Linux had become popular by the mid-1990s. On the contrary, a variety of operating systems based on Net 2, including NetBSD, OpenBSD and FreeBSD, remain alive and well today, with small but passionate communities of users.

**Tip of the week**: Use GNU Parallel to make jobs execute in parallel

```sh
# Examples showing how to split the command and the arguments:
% parallel echo {} ::: hello world
hello
world

% parallel echo {1} {2} ::: alpha beta ::: one two
alpha one
alpha two
beta one
beta two

# Convert an audio file simultaneously to multiple formats:
parallel ffmpeg ~/Audio/file.flac ~/Audio/file.{} ::: ogg m4a opus

# Simultaneously convert multiple tab separated files to csv files:
parallel "tr '\t' ',' < {} > {.}.csv" ::: *.tsv

# Create individual directory archives simultaneously:
% ls
dir1 dir2 dir3
% find . -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d | parallel "tar -czf {.}.tar.gz {}"
% ls
dir1 dir1.tar.gz dir2 dir2.tar.gz dir3 dir3.tar.gz
```
