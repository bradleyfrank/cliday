1. [dasel](https://github.com/TomWright/dasel): Select, put and delete data from JSON, TOML, YAML, XML and CSV files with a single tool
2. [keychain](https://github.com/funtoo/keychain): keychain ssh-agent front-end

**Article of the week**: [A Brief History of the 'ls' command](https://tldp.org/LDP/LG/issue48/fischer.html)

> The ls command, which lists files, is one of the most essential utilities for Unix and Linux users and, not surprisingly, one of the oldest. In its earliest form it was called `listf` and was available on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Compatible Time Sharing System (CTSS) by July, 1961.

**Tip of the week**: Managing your passphrase-protected ssh keys with Keychain:

Interacting with `ssh-agent` can be confusing, using `keychain` to manage your ssh keys means only entering your passphrase once, at boot time. Add the following to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```sh
# macOS
eval "$(keychain --eval --ignore-missing --quiet --inherit any id_rsa id_ed25519 google_compute_engine)"
# Linux
eval "$(keychain --eval --ignore-missing --quiet id_rsa id_ed25519 google_compute_engine)"
```

If you're not a CLI purist, 1Password [can also manage your ssh keys](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/agent/) in the same way.
