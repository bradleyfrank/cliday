1. [tealdeer](https://github.com/dbrgn/tealdeer): A very fast implementation of tldr in Rust
2. [prettyping](https://github.com/denilsonsa/prettyping): A wrapper around the standard `ping` tool, making the output prettier, more colorful, more compact, and easier to read

**Tip of the week:** Easily insert a blank line between concatenated files

For example:

```sh
% printf "1: file ending with no newline" > 1.txt
% echo "2: file ending with a newline" > 2.txt

% cat *.txt
1: file ending with no newline2: file ending with a newline

% awk 'FNR==1{print ""}1' *.txt

1: file ending with no newline

2: file ending with a newline

% awk 'FNR==2{print ""}1' *.txt
1: file ending with no newline
2: file ending with a newline
```
