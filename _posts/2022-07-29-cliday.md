**Article of the week**: [A Little Story About the 'yes' Unix Command](https://endler.dev/2017/yes/)

> The trivial program yes turns out not to be so trivial after all. It uses output buffering and memory alignment to improve performance.

**Tip of the week**: Using number ranges for loops and profit:

```sh
% seq 10        # print "1" through "10" on newlines
% echo {1..10}  # print "1" through "10" on a single line
% seq 3 3 21    # print "3" through "21", every third number

# generate a random number of a specific length
% for _ in {1..5}; do echo -n $((RANDOM % 10)); done

# create numbered directories in intervals of four from "4" through "32"
% for i in $(seq 4 4 32); do mkdir "folder-${i}"; done
```
