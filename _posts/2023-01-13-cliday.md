## Tip of the Week

Using shell history to be quick and efficient:

- The 'arrow-up' key inserts your previous command
- Use `ctrl-r` keyboard shortcut to search through your history
- Zsh has a builtin `r` (alias for `fc -e -`) command:
    ```
    % kubectl --context dev-gke get pods -n namespace
    % r dev=prod
    kubectl --context prod-gke get pods -n namespace
    ```
- The `history` command, which is really just `fc`, has numerous flags:
  - `fc` alone open your editor of choice to edit the last command
  - `fc -l` prints your recent history
  - `fc <num>` opens your editor with the command with that history ID
  - `fc <num> <num>` edits commands in that range
  - `fc -s <num>` runs the command without editing
- The ever-popular `!!` for executing the previous command without editing
  - `!!:s/foo/bar` executes the last command, replacing the first 'foo' with 'bar' (like `r`)
  - `!!:gs/foo/bar` is the same as above, except replacing all instances of 'foo'
  - `!!:$` inserts the last argument from the previous command into your new command (aliased to `!$`)
      ```
      % mkdir /tmp/baz
      % cd !$
      cd /tmp/baz
      ```
