## Tip of the Week

Using the GitHub CLI tool, `gh`, you can create and edit gists. However, to update a gist, you are required to open the file in your set editor. But we can get around this by using the `VISUAL` environment variable, and the `tee` program.

### Part 1: `EDITOR` and `VISUAL`

In historical content, `EDITOR` would be a lightweight editor (e.g. `ed`) and `VISUAL` would be a full-fledged editor (e.g. `vi`). Nowadays, you can set them both to the same (e.g. `vim`, `emacs`), and you may even opt to set `VISUAL` to a GUI app (e.g. `code` for VSCode). The shell will open the appropriate program when applicable. Side note: this is similar for the `PAGER` variable as well, e.g. set it to `bat` instead of `less`.

### Part 2: Piping with `tee`

The `tee` programs lets us split output, to stdout but also to a file. Some examples:

```
% date >&1  # a verbose way to show redirection to stdout
% date >&2  # redirection to stderr
% date > /tmp/date  # output to a file
% date >> /tmp/date  # append output to a file

% date | tee /tmp/date  # output to stdout _and_ a file
% date | tee -a /tmp/date  # stdout and append to a file

# pipe to stdout but also pipe to additional commands
% date +%F_%T | tee /dev/tty | tr -d ":-" | tr "_" "-"

```

### Part 3: Putting it Together

Since `gh` supports `VISUAL`, we set it to `tee` so that reading in a file pipes the file contents into `gh` without ever opening an editor. The final `> /dev/null` sinkholes the file contents since we don't need to actually see it in stdout.

```
VISUAL=tee gh gist edit GIST < /path/to/file > /dev/null
```
