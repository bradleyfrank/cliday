**Tip of the week:** Use `awk` to increment a semantic version number

Split the string by a period character, and `$NF` will represent the last segment of the version number. The output field separator is also set to a period character so the return string is in semver format. For example:

```sh
% echo "3.6" | awk -v FS=. -v OFS=. '{$NF++;print}'
3.7

% echo "3.6.13" | awk -v FS=. -v OFS=. '{$NF++;print}'
3.6.14

% echo "3.6.13" | awk -v FS=. -v OFS=. '{$(NF-1)++;print}'
3.7.13

% echo "3.6.13" | awk -F. '{$(NF-2)++;print $1}'
