**Article of the week**: [Yes, pgrep and pkill originally come from Solaris](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4306515)

> Also, as long as I'm commenting again on this, I should point out that pkill also had an Easter egg of sorts: "pkill -V" was a shorthand for killing everyone's least favorite Solaris daemon: vold.

**Tip of the week**: Using secrets securely when building container images:

A common pattern is keeping credentials in `.npmrc` or `pip.conf` to access private repositories. To prevent those credentials from being baked into the container image, use the `mount` option.

```Dockerfile
# pip example
...
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=pip_conf,dst=/etc/pip.conf pip install -r requirements.txt
...

# npm example
...
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=npmrc,dst=/etc/npmrc npm install
...
```

A manual build:

```sh
docker build --secret id=pip_conf,src=/path/to/pip.conf .
docker build --secret id=npmrc,src=/path/to/npmrc .
```

Building from Compose:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    build:
      secrets:
        - pip_conf
        - npmrc
secrets:
  pip_conf:
    file: /path/to/pip.conf
  npmrc:
    file: /path/to/npmrc
```
