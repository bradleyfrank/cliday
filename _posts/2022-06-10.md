**Article of the week:** [6 deprecated Linux commands and the tools you should be using instead](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/deprecated-linux-command-replacements)

> This article shares a handful of older tools that you might be still using, what you should be using instead, and why you should switch to these improved alternatives that provide the same functionality, if not more.

**Tip of the week:** Use Python as a simple `jq` replacement:

```sh
foo='{"cities": {"boston": "ma", "miami": "fl", "seattle": "wa"}}'
python -c "import sys, json;print(json.loads(sys.stdin.read())['cities']['seattle'])" <<< "$foo"
# Bonus: use `jo` to create json:
foo="$(jo -p cities=$(jo boston=ma miami=fl seattle=wa))"
```
