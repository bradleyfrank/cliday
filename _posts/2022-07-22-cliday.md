**Article of the week**: [What happens when you press a key in your terminal?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/07/20/pseudoterminals/)

> But all of this was designed in the 70s or 80s or something and then needed to stay the same forever for backwards compatibility, so thatâ€™s what we get :)

**Tip of the week**: Split a string into an array with Zsh:

```sh
# by newline
% foo="one
two
three"
% bar=("${(@f)foo}")
% echo ${bar[1]}
one
# by character
% foo="one:two:three"
% bar=("${(@s/:/)foo}")
% echo ${bar[2]}
two
```
