## Tip of the Week

When you have a process that is stuck or won't respond, a good rule of thumb for escalating `kill`s:

1. `kill -15` (`TERM`)
2. `kill -2` (`INT`)
3. `kill -9` (`KILL`)

The first two options give the misbehaving program a chance to quit gracefully and cleanup after itself. A `-9` may leave artifacts behind (lock files, temp files, etc).

You can list all of the signals with `kill -l`. A function to show the signals and their number:

```
while read -r sig; do
  printf "%s %s\n" "$(kill -l $sig)" "$sig"
done <<< $(kill -l | tr ' ' '\n') | column
```

Bonus:
- Find a process PID with `pgrep <process>`
- To kill all processes that match a name: `pkill -<num> <process>`
