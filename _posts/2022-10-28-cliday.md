## Tip of the Week

The many ways of dealing with file compression:

> A mnemonic for `tar -xzvf file.tar.gz`...
> e[x]tract [z]e [v]arious [f]iles

- Can't remember the tools for every compression algorithm? Try [extract](https://github.com/xvoland/Extract/blob/master/extract.sh)!
- Or (a shameless plug) [my own fork](https://github.com/bradleyfrank/ansible/blob/main/playbooks/files/dotfiles/.local/bin/extract) with added functionality!
- Here's a function to gzip a folder: `tardir () { tar -czf "${1%/}".tar.gz "$1"; }`; usage: `tardir <FOLDER_NAME>`
- A oneliner to download and extract single-file zip archives: `curl -sN https://.../example.zip | funzip - > ~/extracted-file`

Bonus tip! Can't transfer files (binary, zip, etc.), but only text? Use `base64`:

```sh
# convert to base64:
base64 -w0 /path/to/file | pbcopy  # or `xclip`, `xsel` for Linux
# transfer the text using your chosen method, the recipient should paste the plaintext in a file:
base64 -d /path/to/encoded/file > /path/to/decoded/file
```
