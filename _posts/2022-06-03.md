**Tip of the week:** How to batch install Homebrew packages for a quick bootstrap:

```sh
# On the existing system, dump all installed packages (taps, formulas, casks, and app store):
% brew bundle dump
# This creates a 'Brewfile' in the current directory:
% cat Brewfile
# Copy this file to a new system and run:
% brew bundle install
# To keep your system up-to-date using this method check out:
% brew bundle --help
# Pair this with `stow` to quickly install dotfiles and get a new system running in no time!
```
