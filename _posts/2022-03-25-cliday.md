**Tip of the week:** Remove duplicate lines without sorting

If you have data with duplicate lines but don't want to change the order, try `awk '!a[$0]++'`! For example:

```sh
% cat << EOF > file1
Apple
Orange
Orange
Banana
Apple
Pineapple
EOF

% awk '!a[$0]++' file1
Apple
Orange
Banana
Pineapple
```

How does this work? You can read a wonderful walkthrough at [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/19/10/remove-duplicate-lines-files-awk).
