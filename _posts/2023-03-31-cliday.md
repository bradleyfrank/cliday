## Tip of the Week

Quickly bookmark a command from your history:

```
# view your recent commands:
% history  # this is equivalent to `fc -l`

# show a specific range from history:
% fc -l <start> <end>  # e.g. `fc -l 5 10` to show the 5th through 10th entries

# drop the index number to get just the command:
% fc -ln

# pipe the results to `fzf` to make selection easier:
% fc -ln | fzf -1 -0 --multi

# and finally append the selection to a file for reference:
% fc -ln | fzf -1 -0 --multi >> /path/to/command/history

# wrap it in a function, with some default values, to call anytime:
% cmdbookmark() { fc -ln "${1:-1}" "${2:--1}" | fzf -1 -0 --multi >> /path/to/command/history; }
```
