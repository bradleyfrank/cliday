**Tip of the week**: Using `shuf` and `xargs` to create a simple dicware app:

* `/usr/share/dict/words` is a builtin dictionary
* `shuf` randomizes input
* `xargs` executes a given command on each input (by default the command is `echo`)

```sh
# randomly select 5 words from the dictionary:
% shuf -n 5 /usr/share/dict/words

# join the output into one line:
% shuf -n 5 /usr/share/dict/words | xargs  # this is equivalent to `xargs -I{} echo {}`

# make multiple passphrases at once:
% shuf -n 15 /usr/share/dict/words | xargs -n 5

# change the delimeter from space to a character:
% shuf -n 5 /usr/share/dict/words | xargs | tr ' ' '-'
```
