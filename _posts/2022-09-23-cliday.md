**Article of the week**: [Open Source Bait and Switch](https://debugagent.com/open-source-bait-and-switch)

> “…cURL is used by pretty much everyone but I don’t think we’ll see a cURL foundation... Does this mean all open source should be a hobby or a mega-all encompassing project?”

**Tip of the week**: String slicing and splitting:

```sh
% f="path1/path2/file.ext"

% echo "${#f}"  # number of characters

# slicing: ${<var>:<start>} or ${<var>:<start>:<length>}
% echo "${f:6}"   # path2/file.ext
% echo "${f:6:5}" # path2
% echo "${f: -8}" # file.ext

# splitting
% echo "${f#*.}"       # "ext"
% echo "${f##*/}"       # "file.ext"
% echo "$(basename $f)" # "file.ext"
% echo "${f%/*}"         # "path1/path2"
% echo "$(dirname $f)"   # "path1/path2"
% echo "${f%%/*}"           # "path1"
```
