## Tip of the Week

Tips for managing your SSH keys:

```
# Generate cryptographically strong keys:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096  # the bit-length is important, see below

# Regenerate a public key from a private key:
ssh-keygen -yf /path/to/private-key > /path/to/public-key.pub

# Update your passphrase (entering a new blank passphrase effectively removes the passphrase):
ssh-keygen -pf /path/to/private-key

# Show key info (fingerprint):
ssh-keygen -lf /path/to/keyfile
```
