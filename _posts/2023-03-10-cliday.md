## Tip of the Week

Displaying text in the terminal:

```
# because I like this trick: download three paragraphs of lorem ipsum:
% curl -s -X POST https://lipsum.com/feed/json -d "amount=3" -d "what=paras" -d "start=true" \
  | jq -r '.feed.lipsum' | fmt -w 80 > /tmp/lorem.txt

cat /tmp/lorem.txt     # print entire file, not scrollable
cat -n /tmp/lorem.txt  # prints entire file with line numbers
view /tmp/lorem.txt    # opens the file in Vim in read-only mode
more /tmp/lorem.txt    # print with scroll down, clears the screen at exit
less /tmp/lorem.txt    # print with bidirectinal scroll, clears the screen at exit, configurable
bat /tmp/lorem.txt     # includes syntax highlighting; see `https://github.com/sharkdp/bat`

# using `head` and `tail`:
tail -n2 /tmp/lorem.txt  # print the last two lines
tail -n+2 /tmp/lorem.txt  # print all but the first two lines
head -n2 /tmp/lorem.txt  # print the first two lines
head -n-2 /tmp/lorem.txt  # print all but the last two lines
```
