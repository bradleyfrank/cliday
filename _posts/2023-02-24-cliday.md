## Tip of the Week

Using named pipes:

Processes can pipe output to other processes, e.g. `ps | grep vim | wc -l`, or files, e.g. `pgrep vim > /tmp/vim_pids`. If the processes need to communicate between users, for example, or are separated for any reason, you can use a named pipe.

```
# create the named pipe in an appropriate location
mkfifo /tmp/fifo

# for demonstration purposes, simple output to stdout
tail -f /tmp/fifo | tr ' ' '-'

# now begin the source process in another shell
while :; do date > /tmp/fifo; sleep 1; done
```

You'll witness the input into `/tmp/fifo` as the output, transformed by `tr`. You can start and stop either process at any time, and the named pipe will remain.
