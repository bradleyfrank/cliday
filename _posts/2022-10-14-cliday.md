**Article of the week**: [How old various Unix signals are](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/SignalsHowOld)

> The low numbered signals are the same as they are today, which at least suggests that they date back pretty far. And apart from signal 9 (SIGKILL), signals from 4 (SIGINS, illegal instruction) through 12 (SIGSYS, bad argument to system call) all seem aimed at telling you about specific internal program issues instead of being something that you would actively send.

**Tip of the week**: Searching for files on your system

```sh
# The `find` command is the default go-to included in Unix systems:
% touch file{1..5} && mkdir dir{6..9} && mkdir -p dir10/folder{1..5}

% find . -type f
./file3
./file4
./file5
./file2
./file1

% find . -type d
.
./dir10
./dir10/folder5
./dir10/folder2
./dir10/folder3
./dir10/folder4
./dir10/folder1
./dir6
./dir8
./dir9
./dir7

# Restict searching depth with -mindepth and -maxdepth:
% find . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d
./dir10
./dir6
./dir8
./dir9
./dir7

# Perform operations on the results:
% brew info coreutils --json > coreutils.json && brew info git --json > git.json
% find . -type f -name '*.json' -exec jq '.[]|.desc' {} \;
"GNU File, Shell, and Text utilities"
"Distributed revision control system"

# Delete matching results:
% find . -type f -name '*.json' -delete
```

Other search tools include:

* [mdfind](https://ss64.com/osx/mdfind.html) for macOS (Spotlight CLI)
* [locate](https://ss64.com/osx/locate.html) for Linux
* [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to `find`
