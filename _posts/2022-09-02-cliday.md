1. [xplr](https://github.com/sayanarijit/xplr): A hackable, minimal, fast TUI file explorer
2. [bearings](https://github.com/liamg/bearings): A fast, clean, customisable shell prompt for zsh, bash, fish, and more...

**Article of the week**: [ASCII and Unicode quotation marks](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/quotes.html)

> The old X fonts encouraged some authors of Unix software and documentation to abuse `0x60` together with `0x27` as directional quotation marks. This practice looked somewhat acceptable like `‛quotation’` if displayed with old X fonts, but it looked rather ugly like `` `quotation' `` in most other modern display environments.

**Tip of the week**: Edit long commands with a text editor in Zsh:

1. Add the following lines to `~/.zshrc`:

   ```sh
   export EDITOR=vim  # use your editor of choice, e.g. vim, nano, etc
   autoload -U edit-command-line  # loads the 'edit-command-line' function
   zle -N edit-command-line  # makes the function a Zsh widget
   bindkey <key> edit-command-line  # bind a key sequence to the widget
                                    # e.g. '^X^E' (ctrl x e), '\033' (esc)
                                    # use `bindkey` command to get a list
   ```

2. Save, and reload the shell with `exec zsh`.
3. Enter command line edit mode from the shell prompt using your chosen key shortcut.
