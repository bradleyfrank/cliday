**Article of the week**: [Unix legend, who owes us nothing, keeps fixing foundational AWK code](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/unix-legend-who-owes-us-nothing-keeps-fixing-foundational-awk-code/)

> Kernighan, now 80, offhandedly mentions in the interview that he has also patched something "quick and dirty" to let AWK handle CSV files.

**Tip of the week**: Getting information about your system:

```sh
uptime # uptime
id # user information

pmset -g batt # macOS battery
cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/{capacity,status} # Linux battery

sw_vers # macOS system info
cat /etc/os-release # Linux distro info

system_profiler # macOS system profile
dmidecode # Linux system profile

systemstats # macOS system stats
sysstat # Linux system stats

sudo softwareupdate -aiR # install macOS updates and reboot
```
